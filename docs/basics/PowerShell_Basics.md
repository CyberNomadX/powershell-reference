# üß† PowerShell for Absolute Beginners

This guide covers the very basics of PowerShell‚Äîwhat it is, how to use it, and how to understand the core concepts before diving into scripting.

## üí° What is PowerShell?

PowerShell is a **command-line shell** and **scripting language** built by Microsoft.  
It lets you manage and automate nearly every part of Windows‚Äîand even works on Linux and macOS.

It‚Äôs:
- Object-based (not just text)
- Integrated with .NET
- Extremely powerful for system admins

---

## üìü Opening PowerShell

To start PowerShell:

- On Windows: Press `Windows + X`, then select **Windows PowerShell** or **Terminal**
- Or type `powershell` into the Start menu

You‚Äôll see a prompt that looks like:
```
PS C:\Users\YourName>
```

You‚Äôre now in the PowerShell environment.

## üîπ Running Commands

PowerShell works by typing in **commands** (called *cmdlets*):

```powershell
Get-Date
```

This shows the current date and time.

```powershell
Get-Process
```

Shows all running processes.

```powershell
Get-Service
```

Lists all system services.

Most cmdlets follow the **Verb-Noun** format:
```
Get-Item
Set-ExecutionPolicy
New-LocalUser
```

## üß™ Try This

Type each of these into PowerShell and press Enter:

```powershell
Get-Location      # Shows your current folder
Get-ChildItem     # Lists files/folders (like 'ls' or 'dir')
Clear-Host        # Clears the screen
```

---

## üß† Cmdlet Breakdown

Let‚Äôs break down one:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Windows -Recurse
```

- `Get-ChildItem`: the main command
- `-Path`: tells it where to look
- `-Recurse`: includes subfolders

This command lists **every file** in `C:\Windows` and its subfolders.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tab Completion

Type the first few letters of a command and hit `Tab`:
```powershell
Get-Pro [Tab] ‚Üí Get-Process
```

Same works for parameter names and paths:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Pat [Tab]
```
